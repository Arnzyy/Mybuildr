## Instagram Setup

Instagram requires the most setup because it uses Facebook's API. You need **three things**:

### Step 1: Create a Facebook Page (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [facebook.com/pages/create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create)
2. Choose "Business or Brand"
3. Enter your business name (e.g., "ABC Construction")
4. Complete the setup

### Step 2: Convert Instagram to a Professional Account

1. Open the **Instagram app** on your phone
2. Go to your **Profile** → tap the **menu** (three lines)
3. Tap **Settings and privacy**
4. Tap **Account type and tools**
5. Tap **Switch to professional account**
6. Choose **Business** (not Creator)
7. Select a category for your business
8. Complete the setup

### Step 3: Link Instagram to Your Facebook Page

This is the critical step that most people miss. Your Instagram Business account must be **linked to your Facebook Page**.

**Option A: From Instagram (Recommended)**

1. Open **Instagram app** → go to your **Profile**
2. Tap **Edit profile**
3. Tap **Page** (under "Profile information")
4. Select your Facebook Page from the list
5. If you don't see your Page, tap **Create a new Facebook Page** or make sure you're logged into the correct Facebook account

**Option B: From Meta Business Suite**

1. Go to [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)
2. Click the **Settings** gear icon (bottom left)
3. Click **Accounts** → **Instagram accounts**
4. Click **Add Instagram Account**
5. Log into your Instagram account
6. Select which Facebook Page to connect it to

**Option C: From Facebook Page Settings**

1. Go to your Facebook Page
2. Click **Settings** (or **Manage** → **Settings**)
3. Click **Linked Accounts** or **Instagram**
4. Click **Connect Account**
5. Log into Instagram and authorize

### Step 4: Connect in ByteTrade

1. Go to ByteTrade Admin → **Social Accounts**
2. Click **Connect Instagram**
3. When Facebook asks, select your **Facebook Page**
4. Select your **Instagram account**
5. Grant all the requested permissions
6. Click **Save**

You should be redirected back to ByteTrade with Instagram showing as connected.

## Facebook Setup

Facebook is simpler - you just need a Facebook Page.

### Step 1: Create a Facebook Page (if you don't have one)

1. Go to [facebook.com/pages/create](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create)
2. Choose "Business or Brand"
3. Enter your business name
4. Complete the setup

## Google Business Setup

### Step 1: Create/Claim Your Google Business Profile

1. Go to [business.google.com](https://business.google.com)
2. Search for your business or click **Add your business**
3. Follow the verification process (postcard, phone, or email)
4. Complete your business profile

### Step 2: Connect in ByteTrade

1. Go to ByteTrade Admin → **Social Accounts**
2. Click **Connect Google Business**
3. Sign in with the Google account that manages your business
4. Select your business location
5. Grant the requested permissions

## Troubleshooting

### "You don't have any Instagram accounts"

This means your Instagram isn't linked to your Facebook Page. Follow Step 3 in the Instagram section above.

### "No Instagram Business account found"

This means either:
- Your Instagram is still a Personal account (not Business/Creator) - do Step 2
- Your Instagram Business account isn't linked to the Facebook Page you selected - do Step 3

### OAuth keeps cancelling / redirecting to error

1. Make sure you're granting ALL the permissions requested
2. Try on a desktop browser instead of mobile
3. Clear your browser cookies and try again
4. Make sure you're logged into the correct Facebook account

### "Token expires soon" warning

Social media tokens expire periodically. Simply click **Reconnect** on the account card to refresh the token.
